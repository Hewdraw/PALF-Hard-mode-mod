red @confused "Beg pardon?"

janine @talkingmouth "The point is, I literally don't have a single reason why I shouldn't be able to be number one. I have no weakness. {i}Nothing{/i} is holding me back."

janine @talkingmouth "Nothing, really. Lance just asked enough that my Dad gave in."

red @happy "Woah. That worked?"

janine @talkingmouth "He asked every day. No matter {i}what{/i}. Rain, shine, no matter where Lance started his day, at 5 PM, he would show up at my family's door. We had him over for dinner a lot."
