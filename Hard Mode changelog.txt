Rebalanced Electives:
	o start with 5 in each elective and elective gain is halved
	o You can only study each type once per week during free time
	o Beating an Elective test gives every other type a small increase to proficiency gain and slows down proficiency gain for that type
	o Profiency gain for a type is disabled if you have a test pending that you have yet to beat
	o studying with someone during lunch now gives you the elective gain for all of their electives
QOL:
	o hovering over a health bar in battle shows that pokemons summary
Battles:
	o increased the difficulty of most battles
	o improved the intelligence 1 ai
	o frenzied pokemon cannot be caught if they are above half health and cannot be critical captured
Bug Fixes:
	o implemented the spread move penalty
	o fixed the damage formula to be more accurate
	o screens only reduce damage by a third for teams with 2 or more pokemon
	o fainted pokemon now only switch out at the end of a turn
	o moves that check for a pokemons last move no longer check for a move used before switching out
